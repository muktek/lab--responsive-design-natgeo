# Responsive Design + SCSS - National Geographic

## Context
National Geographic originated as a popular print magazine that reports on interesting topics, discoveries, and developments in anthropology and nature. It now provides most of its content online and is looking for a front-end developer to build a responsive front-end for their *Photography* section. The designer has created mock ups of the mobile, tablet, and desktop prototypes.

## Objectives
- Create a mobile-first layout with elements whose styles change on the page based on the width of the viewport.
- Incorporate SCSS into your styles workflow

### Learning Objectives
After completing this assignment you should be able to
- Use SCSS to make CSS coding quicker and easier
- Use media queries to elements on the page based on the width of the viewport
- Improve your attention to detail by implementing appropriate margin, padding, font-sizes, and column layouts based on a designer's specification

### Performance Objectives
- Responsive first design. (Create your base styles and use `min-width` in your media queries to modify elements that change on wider viewports)
- You should make use of SCSS:
  + variables
  + mixins


### Deliverables
- an `index.html` file with the content
- a `main.scss` file in a `scss` directory with your styles that compiles to a `style.css` file inside a `css` directory
- a site that replicates the styles as shown below
- a site that uses CSS media queries and displays responsively as shown below
- a public Github repository

## Setup
1. Use the `gen-project-scss` script to create the files and folders for the project.
  ```bash
  cd ~/muktek/labs
  gen-scss-project responsive-design-natgeo
  ```

2. `cd` into `responsive-design-natgeo`

3. Use the `watch-scss` command in the project's root directory to compile the scss to 'watch' for changes in your `.scss` files and update your `style.css` file.

4. Download image assets
  ```sh
  curl  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muktek/lab--responsive-design-natgeo/master/image-files.zip > image-files.zip

  unzip image-files.zip
  ```
